# Data-mining-algorithms-implementation
Some algorithms in data mining

I learned these algorithms in my Data Mining course in CUHK.

I implement some of them in python to help me get a more clear picture about them

Project #1: Decision Tree

Project #2: Perceptron
Goal

Implement the maximum-margin perceptron algorithm in Lecture 5.
Dataset

Your implementation should work on any dataset stored in a text file of the following format:
The first line contains two numbers n and d, where n is the number of points, and d is the number of describing attributes.
The i-th line (where i goes from 2 to n + 1) gives the (i - 1)-th point in the dataset as: 
x1 x2 ... xd c
where the first d values are the coordinates of the point, and c = 1 (if the point is blue) or 0 (red).

Project #6: DBSCAN

Goal

Implement the DBSCAN algorithm discussed in Lecture 8.
Dataset

Download http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/course/cmsc5724/data/3spiral.txt (obtained from the data collection here(http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/)). Each line has the following format: 

x y

which represent the x- and y-coordinates of a point.
Task

Partition the dataset into 3 clusters.
