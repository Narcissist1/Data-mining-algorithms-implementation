Some algorithms in data mining

I learned these algorithms in my Data Mining course in CUHK.

I implement some of them in python to help me get a more clear picture about them

Project #1: Decision Tree

Project #2: Perceptron
Goal

Implement the maximum-margin perceptron algorithm in Lecture 5.
Dataset

Your implementation should work on any dataset stored in a text file of the following format:
The first line contains two numbers n and d, where n is the number of points, and d is the number of describing attributes.
The i-th line (where i goes from 2 to n + 1) gives the (i - 1)-th point in the dataset as: 
x1 x2 ... xd c 
where the first d values are the coordinates of the point, and c = 1 (if the point is blue) or 0 (red).
An example dataset of 4 two-dimensional points is: 
4 2 
1 2 0 
2 1 0 
3 2 1 
2 4 1 
Deliverables

An executable program which should work for any dimensionality d.
A readme file detailing how to use the program.
Source code.
